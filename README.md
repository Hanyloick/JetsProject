# JetsProject



# OverView
On startup JetsApplication will call on the AirField to read the .txt file and add each jet to the list.<br> The user will then be
presented with a menu that will allow the user to, list all available Jets on the AirFields list, call the fly method of all available jets,<br>
print out the fastest Jet in the current collection, print out the Jet that has the farthest Range,<br> call the loadJets method from the CargoCarrier Interface, call the dogfight method from the FighterInterface, add a customized Jet to the fleet,<br> and remove jets from the fleet.
The user can continue using menu items until the "quit" option is selected by entering the number "9".

# Lessons Learned
- Abstraction- planning out what classes were needed and how each class will interact with each other.<br>
- Inheritance- all subclasses of jets held the same fields and methods of jet.<br>
- Polymorphism-  all subclasses of jets had their own specialized behaviors but still maintained behaviors inherited from the Jet abstract class.<br>
- Encapsulation- all fields are private or protected to protect each classes data.<br>
-
